MySQL schema design: https://ibb.co/fx22PD3

JavaFx project made using MySQL. Has an admin, lecturer and student section. The student can create an account from the signup page while the admin can create a lecturer account. The admin can delete accounts, change passwords and view the accounts in the schema. The lecturer can add, edit and delete grades of a student record. He/She can also delete student accounts, view the students in the database and view students currently passing or failing the course. They can also query the grades, outputting students with an average lower than, equal to or greater than or equal to an average of their choice. The student can view their grades.
